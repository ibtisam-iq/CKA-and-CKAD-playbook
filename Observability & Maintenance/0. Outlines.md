## Application Observability and Maintenance
## 1. Understand API Deprecations

#### In-Depth Topics to Cover:
- **Kubernetes API Basics**:
  - Understand Kubernetes APIs: core (`v1`), named groups (e.g., `apps/v1`, `networking.k8s.io/v1`).
  - Study resource versioning: `alpha`, `beta`, and stable (e.g., `v1`, `v1beta1`).
  - Learn API groups and resources (e.g., `Pod`, `Deployment`, `Ingress`) using `kubectl api-resources`.

- **API Deprecation Process**:
  - Understand Kubernetes’ deprecation policy: APIs are deprecated in favor of newer versions.
  - Study typical deprecation timeline: ~12 months notice, starting from minor releases (e.g., v1.29 deprecates, v1.32 removes).
  - Learn common deprecations (e.g., `extensions/v1beta1` for `Ingress` → `networking.k8s.io/v1` in v1.22).
  - Explore removed APIs: check release notes (e.g., v1.25 removed `PodSecurityPolicy`).

- **Impact on Resources**:
  - Understand how deprecated APIs affect manifests (e.g., updating `apiVersion` in YAML).
  - Study `kubectl convert` to migrate old manifests to newer API versions.
  - Learn about API compatibility: clusters support multiple versions during transition.

- **Practical Skills**:
  - Check API availability with `kubectl api-versions` and `kubectl api-resources`.
  - Update YAML manifests to use supported `apiVersion` (e.g., `apps/v1` for Deployments).
  - Use `kubectl convert` to migrate deprecated resources (requires `kubectl-convert` plugin).
  - Identify deprecated APIs in a cluster with `kubectl get --all-namespaces -o yaml`.
  - Troubleshoot errors caused by deprecated APIs (e.g., `not found` or `no longer served`).

#### Expected Question Types:
- **Task-Based**:
  - Update a Deployment YAML from `apps/v1beta1` to `apps/v1` and apply it.
  - Convert an old `Ingress` manifest (`extensions/v1beta1`) to `networking.k8s.io/v1` using `kubectl convert`.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Fix a `kubectl apply` error caused by a deprecated `apiVersion` (e.g., `extensions/v1beta1` for Ingress).
  - Debug a resource creation failure due to an unsupported API version.
- **Validation**:
  - Verify a resource uses the correct `apiVersion` with `kubectl get <resource> -o yaml`.
  - Confirm no deprecated APIs are used in a namespace with `kubectl get --all-namespaces`.

### 2. Implement Probes and Health Checks

#### In-Depth Topics to Cover:
- **Probe Types**:
  - **Liveness Probe**: Detects if a container is healthy; restarts pod if it fails.
  - **Readiness Probe**: Determines if a pod is ready to serve traffic; removes from service endpoints if it fails.
  - **Startup Probe**: Delays liveness checks for slow-starting apps; ensures initialization completes.
  - Study probe methods:
    - `httpGet`: Checks HTTP response (e.g., status 200 on `/health`).
    - `tcpSocket`: Verifies TCP port is open.
    - `exec`: Runs a command (e.g., `cat /tmp/healthy`); exit code 0 indicates success.

- **Probe Configuration**:
  - Learn key fields: `initialDelaySeconds`, `periodSeconds`, `timeoutSeconds`, `successThreshold`, `failureThreshold`.
  - Understand probe tuning: balance responsiveness with stability (e.g., avoid false positives).
  - Study common patterns: HTTP health endpoints, file-based checks, TCP port checks.

- **Health Check Impact**:
  - Liveness: Prevents stuck pods (e.g., deadlocks, crashes) by triggering restarts.
  - Readiness: Ensures traffic only goes to healthy pods (critical for rolling updates).
  - Startup: Protects apps with long initialization (e.g., databases, JVM apps).

- **Practical Skills**:
  - Configure liveness, readiness, and startup probes in pod YAMLs.
  - Test probe behavior by simulating failures (e.g., HTTP 500, missing file).
  - Monitor probe status with `kubectl describe pod` (check `Events`).
  - Troubleshoot probe failures causing pod restarts or traffic issues.
  - Validate probe effectiveness with `kubectl get pods` and service access.

#### Expected Question Types:
- **Task-Based**:
  - Add a liveness probe to a pod checking `/health` on port 8080 every 10 seconds.
  - Configure a readiness probe to ensure a pod serves traffic only after a TCP port 3306 is open.
  - Set up a startup probe for a slow app with a 60-second delay before liveness checks.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Fix a pod in `CrashLoopBackOff` due to a liveness probe failing (e.g., wrong endpoint).
  - Debug a service routing traffic to unready pods because of a misconfigured readiness probe.
- **Validation**:
  - Verify a liveness probe restarts a failed pod with `kubectl describe pod`.
  - Confirm a readiness probe removes a pod from service endpoints using `kubectl get endpoints`.

### 3. Use Built-In CLI Tools to Monitor Kubernetes Applications

#### In-Depth Topics to Cover:
- **kubectl Commands**:
  - **Basic Monitoring**:
    - `kubectl get pods`: Check pod status (`Running`, `Pending`, `CrashLoopBackOff`).
    - `kubectl describe pod`: View events, conditions, and container states.
    - `kubectl logs <pod> --container <container>`: Retrieve container logs for diagnostics.
  - **Resource Usage**:
    - `kubectl top pod`: Monitor CPU/memory usage (requires `metrics-server`).
    - `kubectl top node`: Check node resource utilization.
  - **Cluster Health**:
    - `kubectl get nodes`: Verify node status (`Ready`, `NotReady`).
    - `kubectl cluster-info`: Check control plane accessibility.

  - `kubectl port-forward`: Access pod ports locally for debugging (e.g., `kubectl port-forward pod/<name> 8080:80`).
  - `kubectl events`: View cluster-wide events (or use `--for` with `kubectl describe`).

- **Metrics-Server**:
  - Understand `metrics-server` for enabling `kubectl top`.
  - Learn to deploy `metrics-server` if not present (e.g., via Helm or YAML).

- **Practical Skills**:
  - Use `kubectl get` and `describe` to monitor pod and node health.
  - Check resource usage with `kubectl top` and correlate with application issues.
  - Run diagnostic commands in pods with `kubectl exec` (e.g., `ps`, `netstat`).
  - Forward ports to test app endpoints locally.
  - Troubleshoot monitoring issues (e.g., missing `metrics-server`, pod errors).
  - Validate application health with logs and metrics.

#### Expected Question Types:
- **Task-Based**:
  - Use `kubectl top pod` to identify a pod with high CPU usage in namespace `app`.
  - Run `kubectl exec` to check an application’s health endpoint inside a container.
  - Deploy `metrics-server` to enable `kubectl top` in a cluster.
- **Troubleshooting**:

### 4. Utilize Container Logs

#### In-Depth Topics to Cover:
- **Container Logging**:
  - Understand Kubernetes logging: containers write to `stdout`/`stderr`, captured by the runtime.
  - Study log storage: managed by container runtime (e.g., containerd, Docker) or node-level logging.
  - Learn log access: `kubectl logs <pod> --container <container>` for specific containers.

- **Log Retrieval**:
  - Retrieve logs for running pods: `kubectl logs <pod>`.
  - Access logs for crashed containers: `kubectl logs --previous`.
  - Stream logs in real-time: `kubectl logs -f`.
  - Filter logs: `--tail=<lines>`, `--since=<time>` (e.g., `--since=1h`).

- **Multi-Container Pods**:
  - Specify containers in multi-container pods: `--container <name>`.
  - Understand sidecar patterns for logging (e.g., Fluentd sidecar).

- **Practical Skills**:
  - Fetch and analyze logs for debugging application errors.
  - Stream logs to monitor real-time behavior.

  - Validate application behavior by correlating logs with expected output.

#### Expected Question Types:
- **Task-Based**:
  - Retrieve logs for a specific container in a multi-container pod.
  - Stream logs for a pod and identify an error message.
  - Fetch logs for a crashed pod using `kubectl logs --previous`.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Debug a pod with no logs due to a container writing to a file instead of `stdout`.
  - Fix an application error found in logs (e.g., missing environment variable).
- **Validation**:
  - Verify a pod’s logs show expected output (e.g., HTTP 200 responses).
  - Confirm log retrieval works for a restarted container.

### 5. Debugging in Kubernetes

#### In-Depth Topics to Cover:
- **Debugging Workflow**:
  - **Pod Issues**:
    - Check pod status: `Running`, `Pending`, `CrashLoopBackOff`, `ImagePullBackOff`, `Error`.
    - Use `kubectl describe pod` to inspect events (e.g., scheduler failures, image errors).
    - Access logs with `kubectl logs` for application or runtime errors.
  - **Container Issues**:
    - Run `kubectl exec` to inspect container state (e.g., `env`, `cat /etc/config`).
    - Check exit codes in `kubectl describe pod` (e.g., 137 for OOM, 1 for app error).
  - **Node Issues**:
    - Verify node status with `kubectl get nodes` and `kubectl describe node`.
    - Check node logs (e.g., `journalctl -u kubelet`) for kubelet or runtime issues.

- **Common Issues**:
  - **Scheduling Failures**: Insufficient resources, taints, affinity rules.
  - **Image Pull Errors**: Wrong image name, missing `imagePullSecrets`.
  - **CrashLoopBackOff**: Misconfigured probes, app errors, OOM kills.
  - **Network Issues**: DNS failures, service endpoint mismatches, CNI problems.

- **Debugging Tools**:
  - `kubectl exec`: Run commands like `curl`, `ps`, `netstat` inside containers.
  - `kubectl port-forward`: Test pod endpoints locally.
  - `kubectl debug`: Create debug pods (node-level or ephemeral containers, less common in CKA).
  - Linux tools: `top`, `df`, `free`, `iptables` (via `kubectl exec` or node access).

- **Practical Skills**:
  - Triage pod issues with `kubectl describe` and `logs`.
  - Debug container failures using `kubectl exec` to inspect runtime state.
  - Simulate failures: bad images, probe errors, resource limits.
  - Troubleshoot cluster-wide issues (e.g., DNS, metrics-server).
  - Validate fixes by redeploying pods or checking app behavior.

#### Expected Question Types:
- **Task-Based**:
  - Debug a pod in `CrashLoopBackOff` and fix its configuration (e.g., wrong env var).
  - Use `kubectl exec` to verify a pod’s application is running correctly.
  - Port-forward a pod’s service to test its endpoint locally.

### General Tips for CKA Application Observability and Maintenance Questions
- **Hands-On Practice**:
  - Use a local cluster (Minikube, Kind, kubeadm) to simulate pod and application failures.
  - Deploy apps with intentional errors (e.g., bad probes, wrong images) to practice debugging.
  - Experiment with `metrics-server`, probes, and logging in namespaces.

- **Command Familiarity**:
  - Master `kubectl` commands: `get`, `describe`, `logs`, `exec`, `top`, `port-forward`, `convert`.
  - Use debugging tools: `curl`, `nslookup`, `ps`, `env` (via `kubectl exec`).
  - Practice filtering logs: `--tail`, `--since`, `--previous`.

- **Time Management**:
  - Debugging can be time-consuming. Start with `kubectl describe pod` to check events.
  - Use `kubectl logs` early to spot application errors.
  - Validate fixes quickly with `kubectl get pods` or `curl` to move on.

- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Missing namespace flags (`-n <namespace>`) for logs or debugging.
  - Overlooking probe misconfigurations causing restarts or traffic issues.
  - Ignoring events in `kubectl describe` output, which often reveal root causes.

### Example Scenario-Based Questions
1. **API Deprecation**:
   - Update a `Deployment` manifest from `apps/v1beta2` to `apps/v1` and redeploy it successfully.

2. **Probes**:
   - Configure a liveness probe for a pod to check `/api/health` every 5 seconds and fix a pod restarting due to a wrong probe path.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Use `kubectl top pod` to find a pod with high memory usage and adjust its limits to stabilize it.

4. **Logs**:
   - Retrieve logs from a crashed container in a multi-container pod and identify the cause (e.g., missing config file).

5. **Debugging**:
   - Debug a pod stuck in `CrashLoopBackOff`, fix an environment variable error, and verify it runs.

### Additional Resources to Maximize Coverage
- **Practice Labs**:
  - Use KillerCoda, KodeKloud, or Play with Kubernetes for observability and debugging scenarios.
  - Deploy apps like Nginx or Redis with probes and simulate failures.

- **Documentation**:
  - Bookmark Kubernetes docs for probes, logging, debugging, and API versioning (allowed in the exam).
  - Study the `kubectl` cheatsheet for monitoring commands.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Simulate complex failures: OOM kills, DNS errors, probe race conditions.
  - Practice debugging multi-container pods with sidecars or init containers.
  - Test deprecated APIs by deploying old manifests and converting them.
