## Storage

### 1. Implement Storage Classes and Dynamic Volume Provisioning

#### In-Depth Topics to Cover:
- **Storage Classes**:
  - Understand the purpose of `StorageClass` objects in Kubernetes for abstracting storage provisioning.
  - Learn how to define a `StorageClass` with fields like `provisioner`, `parameters`, and `reclaimPolicy`.
  - Study common provisioners (e.g., `kubernetes.io/aws-ebs`, `kubernetes.io/gce-pd`, `kubernetes.io/azure-disk`).
  - Explore default `StorageClass` behavior and how to set or unset a default `StorageClass`.
  - Understand how `allowVolumeExpansion` enables resizing of volumes (if supported by the provisioner).

- **Dynamic Volume Provisioning**:
  - Learn how dynamic provisioning eliminates the need for manual `PersistentVolume` (PV) creation.
  - Study the relationship between `StorageClass`, `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC), and dynamically provisioned `PersistentVolume`.
  - Understand how Kubernetes matches a PVC to a `StorageClass` based on the `storageClassName` field.
  - Explore failure scenarios, such as when no `StorageClass` is available or the provisioner fails.

- **Practical Skills**:
  - Create and modify `StorageClass` manifests using YAML.
  - Configure a cluster with a default `StorageClass`.
  - Troubleshoot issues with dynamic provisioning (e.g., PVC stuck in `Pending` state).
  - Verify provisioned storage using `kubectl describe pv` or `kubectl describe pvc`.

#### Expected Question Types:
- **Task-Based**:
  - Create a `StorageClass` with a specific provisioner (e.g., `aws-ebs`) and parameters (e.g., `type=gp2`).
  - Configure a default `StorageClass` for the cluster.
  - Modify an existing `StorageClass` to enable volume expansion.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Debug why a PVC is not binding to a PV (e.g., missing `StorageClass` or misconfigured provisioner).
  - Fix a dynamic provisioning failure due to incorrect `StorageClass` parameters.
- **Validation**:
  - Verify that a `StorageClass` is correctly provisioned by checking PVs and PVCs.
  - Confirm that a default `StorageClass` is applied to PVCs without explicit `storageClassName`.

### 2. Configure Volume Types, Access Modes, and Reclaim Policies

#### In-Depth Topics to Cover:
- **Volume Types**:
  - Understand the differences between volume types like `emptyDir`, `hostPath`, `nfs`, `awsElasticBlockStore`, `gcePersistentDisk`, `azureDisk`, etc.
  - Study cloud-specific volumes (e.g., AWS EBS, GCP Persistent Disk) and their configuration requirements.
  - Learn about CSI (Container Storage Interface) volumes and how they integrate with Kubernetes.
  - Explore ephemeral volumes like `emptyDir` for temporary storage and their lifecycle tied to pods.

- **Access Modes**:
  - Master the three access modes: `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO), `ReadOnlyMany` (ROX), and `ReadWriteMany` (RWX).
  - Understand which volume types support specific access modes (e.g., NFS supports RWX, EBS supports RWO).
  - Study how access modes are defined in PVCs and enforced in PVs.
  - Learn how pod scheduling is affected by access mode constraints (e.g., RWO volumes can only be mounted by one node).

- **Reclaim Policies**:
  - Understand the two main reclaim policies: `Retain` and `Delete`.
  - Learn how reclaim policies are set in `StorageClass` or PV and affect PV lifecycle after PVC deletion.
  - Study the behavior of `Retain` (manual cleanup required) vs. `Delete` (automatic deletion of backing storage).
  - Explore edge cases, such as reclaim policy behavior with dynamically vs. statically provisioned PVs.

- **Practical Skills**:
  - Write YAML manifests for PVs and PVCs with specific volume types and access modes.
  - Configure a pod to use different volume types (e.g., `hostPath` vs. `nfs`).
  - Modify reclaim policies on PVs or `StorageClass` objects.
  - Validate access mode behavior by mounting volumes to multiple pods.

#### Expected Question Types:
- **Task-Based**:
  - Create a PV and PVC with a specific volume type (e.g., `nfs`) and access mode (e.g., `ReadWriteMany`).
  - Configure a pod to use an `emptyDir` volume for temporary storage.
  - Update a PV’s reclaim policy from `Delete` to `Retain`.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Fix a pod that fails to mount a volume due to an incompatible access mode.
  - Resolve a misconfigured volume type (e.g., incorrect `hostPath` or NFS server details).
- **Validation**:
  - Verify that a volume supports the requested access mode by mounting it to multiple pods.
  - Check the reclaim policy of a PV after a PVC is deleted.

### 3. Manage Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims

#### In-Depth Topics to Cover:
- **Persistent Volumes (PVs)**:
  - Understand the PV object and its fields: `capacity`, `accessModes`, `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy`, `storageClassName`, and `volumeMode`.
  - Learn how to create PVs manually for static provisioning.
  - Study PV binding behavior with PVCs based on capacity, access modes, and `storageClassName`.
  - Explore PV lifecycle: `Available`, `Bound`, `Released`, and `Failed`.

- **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**:
  - Understand the PVC object and its fields: `resources.requests.storage`, `accessModes`, and `storageClassName`.
  - Learn how PVCs request storage and bind to PVs (static or dynamic provisioning).
  - Study how to reference PVCs in pod manifests using the `persistentVolumeClaim` volume type.
  - Explore PVC deletion and its impact on PVs based on the reclaim policy.

- **Practical Skills**:
  - Create and delete PVs and PVCs using `kubectl` or YAML manifests.
  - Bind a PVC to a specific PV manually or via dynamic provisioning.
  - Troubleshoot PVC binding issues (e.g., insufficient capacity, mismatched access modes).
  - Use `kubectl describe` and `kubectl get` to inspect PV and PVC status.
  - Mount a PVC in a pod and verify its functionality.

#### Expected Question Types:
- **Task-Based**:
  - Create a PV with 5Gi capacity and a matching PVC to bind to it.
  - Configure a pod to use a PVC for persistent storage.
  - Delete a PVC and verify the PV’s status based on its reclaim policy.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Debug a PVC stuck in `Pending` state due to no matching PV or `StorageClass`.
  - Fix a pod that cannot access its PVC due to a misconfigured volume mount.
- **Validation**:
  - Confirm that a PVC is bound to the correct PV using `kubectl describe pvc`.
  - Verify that a pod is successfully using a PVC-mounted volume.

### 4. Utilize Persistent and Ephemeral Volumes

#### In-Depth Topics to Cover:
- **Persistent Volumes**:
  - Reinforce knowledge of PVs and PVCs for persistent storage across pod lifecycles.
  - Understand use cases for persistent storage (e.g., databases, file storage).
  - Learn how to mount PVs in pods using `persistentVolumeClaim` volumes.
  - Study volume mount options like `subPath` for mounting specific directories.

- **Ephemeral Volumes**:
  - Understand ephemeral volume types like `emptyDir`, `configMap`, `secret`, and `downwardAPI`.
  - Study the lifecycle of `emptyDir` volumes (tied to pod lifetime, deleted when pod terminates).
  - Learn use cases for ephemeral volumes (e.g., caching, temporary data, sharing data between containers).
  - Explore `emptyDir` configuration options like `medium` (e.g., `Memory` for tmpfs).

- **Practical Skills**:
  - Configure pods with both persistent and ephemeral volumes.
  - Use `emptyDir` for inter-container communication within a pod.
  - Mount a PVC and an `emptyDir` volume in the same pod for different purposes.

  - Mount a `configMap` as an ephemeral volume in a pod.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Fix a pod where an `emptyDir` volume is not behaving as expected (e.g., data not shared between containers).
  - Debug a pod failing to mount a PVC due to incorrect volume configuration.
- **Validation**:
  - Verify that data written to a PVC persists after a pod restart.
  - Confirm that data in an `emptyDir` volume is deleted when the pod terminates.

### General Tips for CKA Storage Questions
- **Hands-On Practice**:
  - Set up a local Kubernetes cluster (e.g., using Minikube or Kind) to practice creating PVs, PVCs, and `StorageClass` objects.
  - Experiment with different volume types (e.g., `hostPath`, `emptyDir`) and access modes.
  - Simulate failures, such as missing `StorageClass` or insufficient PV capacity, to practice troubleshooting.

- **Command Familiarity**:
  - Be comfortable with `kubectl create`, `apply`, `describe`, `get`, and `edit` for PVs, PVCs, and `StorageClass`.
  - Use `kubectl logs` and `kubectl describe pod` to debug storage-related issues in pods.
  - Practice filtering output with `kubectl get pv,pvc -o wide` to inspect binding details.

- **Time Management**:
  - Storage tasks can be YAML-heavy. Practice writing manifests quickly or editing existing ones with `kubectl edit`.
  - Use `kubectl create -f` or `kubectl apply -f` to apply configurations efficiently during the exam.

- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Mismatched access modes or capacity between PV and PVC.
  - Forgetting to specify `storageClassName` in PVCs for dynamic provisioning.
  - Incorrect volume mount paths in pod manifests causing failures.

### Example Scenario-Based Questions
1. **Dynamic Provisioning Task**:
   - Create a `StorageClass` named `fast` with the `aws-ebs` provisioner and `type=gp3`. Then, create a PVC requesting 10Gi of storage using this `StorageClass`. Deploy a pod that mounts the PVC and verify the volume is accessible.

2. **Troubleshooting PVC Binding**:
   - A PVC is stuck in `Pending` state. Inspect the cluster, identify the issue (e.g., no matching PV or missing `StorageClass`), and fix it to ensure the PVC binds successfully.

3. **Ephemeral Volume Setup**:
   - Configure a pod with two containers that share an `emptyDir` volume. Ensure one container writes a file to the volume and the other reads it.

4. **Reclaim Policy Adjustment**:
   - Update an existing PV’s reclaim policy to `Retain`. Delete its associated PVC and verify that the PV remains in the `Released` state.
