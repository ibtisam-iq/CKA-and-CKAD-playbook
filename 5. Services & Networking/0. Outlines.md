## Services & Networking

### 1. Understand Connectivity Between Pods

#### In-Depth Topics to Cover:
- **Kubernetes Networking Model**:
  - Understand the Kubernetes networking requirements:
    - Pods can communicate with all other pods without NAT.
    - Nodes can communicate with pods (and vice versa) without NAT.
    - Containers within a pod share a network namespace (localhost communication).
  - Study pod IP allocation: each pod gets a unique IP from the pod CIDR.

  - Learn how CNI plugins (e.g., Flannel, Calico, WeaveNet, Cilium) provide pod networking.
  - Understand CNI components: bridge, veth pairs, routing tables.
  - Study pod-to-pod communication across nodes (e.g., overlay networks, VXLAN).

- **Intra-Pod Networking**:
  - Understand how containers in a pod share a network namespace.
  - Learn localhost communication between containers (e.g., `127.0.0.1:port`).
  - Study port conflicts and container port mappings.

- **Practical Skills**:
  - Deploy pods and verify pod-to-pod connectivity with `ping` or `curl`.
  - Inspect pod IPs and network configuration with `kubectl describe pod` and `kubectl exec`.
  - Install a CNI plugin (e.g., `kubectl apply -f <cni.yaml>`) to enable networking.
  - Troubleshoot connectivity issues (e.g., missing CNI, firewall rules).
  - Simulate network failures (e.g., delete CNI config) to practice debugging.

#### Expected Question Types:

  - Learn IP-based rules (`ipBlock`) and port-based rules (`ports`).

- **Default Behavior**:
  - Understand that pods are non-isolated by default (all traffic allowed).
