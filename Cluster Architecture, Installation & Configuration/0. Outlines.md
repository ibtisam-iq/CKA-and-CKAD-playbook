  - Practice RBAC, SecurityContext, and HA setups in a lab environment (e.g., Minikube, Kind, or KodeKloud labs).
  - Deploy Helm charts and Kustomize overlays for real-world apps (e.g., Nginx, Prometheus).

- **Command Familiarity**:
  - Master `kubectl` commands: `create`, `apply`, `edit`, `auth can-i`, `taint`, `get crd`.
  - Use `kubeadm` commands: `init`, `join`, `upgrade`, `reset`, `certs`.
  - Practice Helm: `helm install`, `helm upgrade`, `helm repo`, `helm rollback`.
  - Run Kustomize: `kubectl apply -k`, `kustomize build`.

- **Time Management**:
  - Cluster setup tasks (e.g., `kubeadm init`) can be time-intensive. Practice workflows to minimize errors.
  - Use `kubectl create --dry-run=client -o yaml` for quick manifests.
  - Validate tasks early with `kubectl get` or `helm status` to avoid rework.

- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Forgetting namespace for RBAC or ServiceAccount tasks (`-n <namespace>`).
  - Misconfiguring `kubeadm init` flags (e.g., wrong CIDR, missing endpoint).
  - Overlooking admission controller or SecurityContext restrictions causing pod failures.

---

### Example Scenario-Based Questions
1. **RBAC**:
   - Create a `Role` in namespace `app` allowing `get` and `list` on pods, and bind it to a ServiceAccount used by a Deployment.

2. **ServiceAccount**:
   - Configure a ServiceAccount with an `imagePullSecret` and assign it to a pod pulling from a private registry.

3. **SecurityContext**:
   - Deploy a pod with a non-root container, dropping `ALL` capabilities except `NET_ADMIN`.

4. **kubeadm Cluster**:
   - Initialize a single-node cluster with `kubeadm init`, install Flannel CNI, and join a worker node.

5. **HA Control Plane**:
   - Set up an HA control plane with two nodes using a provided load balancer address.

6. **Helm/Kustomize**:
   - Install the `metrics-server` Helm chart and use Kustomize to patch its replicas to 3.

7. **CRD/Operator**:
   - Deploy the Prometheus Operator and create a `Prometheus` resource to monitor pods.

---

### Additional Resources to Maximize Coverage
- **Practice Labs**:
  - Use KillerCoda, KodeKloud, or Play with Kubernetes for cluster setup and RBAC scenarios.
  - Deploy `kubeadm` clusters on cloud providers (e.g., AWS, GCP) for HA practice.

- **Documentation**:
  - Bookmark Kubernetes docs for `kubeadm`, RBAC, SecurityContext, Helm, and Kustomize (allowed in the exam).
  - Study the `kubectl` cheatsheet and `kubeadm` reference.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Simulate failures: expired certificates, etcd quorum loss, CNI misconfigurations.
  - Practice upgrading clusters and restoring etcd snapshots.
  - Experiment with complex RBAC policies and SecurityContext restrictions.
